üîç Data Analysis Project: Exploring Games Revenue Dataset üéÆüìä

I recently completed a project analyzing a comprehensive dataset on video games revenue, utilizing various Excel functions to extract valuable insights. Here‚Äôs a brief overview of the techniques I applied:

Data Validation: To ensure accuracy, I created two columns with data validation for text length, specifically for entering game names and publisher details. This step enhances data integrity and consistency.

SUMIF Function: I utilized the SUMIF function to calculate the total average playtime across the dataset. This analysis helps identify trends in gameplay duration and player engagement.

Publisher Class List: I created a column that lists different publisher classes, providing an organized view for further analysis.

Ranking by Review Scores: By ranking games based on their review scores, I could assess which titles received the best feedback, providing insights into player preferences.

Indie Publisher Class Insights: I analyzed the review scores specifically for the indie publisher class, counting the number of reviews. This highlights the performance and reception of indie games in the market.

Pivot Table Creation: I developed a pivot table to showcase the relationship between publisher classes and their respective prices, allowing for quick comparisons and insights.

Lookup Functions: I employed lookup functions to identify game names along with their developers, enhancing the dataset‚Äôs usability.

HLOOKUP for Sales Data: Lastly, I used the HLOOKUP function to retrieve information based on game names and their copies sold, which is crucial for understanding sales performance.

This project not only strengthened my analytical skills but also deepened my understanding of the gaming industry.
